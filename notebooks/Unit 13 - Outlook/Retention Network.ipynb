One example of this is the Transformer architecture; where the self-attention inside the decoder allows token generation that does not depend on the previously generated output. \n",
                "* **Low-cost inference**: During the inference, the cost does not scale with sequence length. One example of this is the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture; where it uses simple and cheap operation like matrix multiplication to process one token at each time step.\n",
